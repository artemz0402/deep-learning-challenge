To begin processing the data, we first eliminated any irrelevant information, including the EIN and NAME columns. The remaining columns were designated as features for our model. In a subsequent test, we added the NAME column back for binning purposes. We then divided the data into training and testing sets, with the target variable, "IS_SUCCESSFUL," set to 1 for success and 0 for failure. We examined the APPLICATION data, focusing on the "CLASSIFICATION" value for binning. Rare variables were grouped into a new category, "Other," based on several cutoff points. After ensuring the binning process was effective, we encoded the categorical variables using get_dummies().
